This is the template in [Documenting architecture decisions - Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

In each ADR file, write these sections:

# Title

## Status

> What is the status, such as proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.?

Imposed :)

## Context

> What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

Suggested reading: https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record
* We adopt this process to keep track of decisions.
* We document the _why_ because it informs us of the _how_

## Decision

> What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences

> What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?
